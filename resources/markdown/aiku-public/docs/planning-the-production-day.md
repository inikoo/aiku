<aside class="tldr">
Two people, two jobs. The <b>manager</b> decides what is made on a day: on the <b>To produce</b> board she picks the cards and presses <b>Plan for this day</b>, without naming anyone. The <b>supervisor</b> opens <b>Operations → Day plan</b> and gives every step of every planned job to an operator. Each operator then sees their own steps on the floor screen. Anything not finished on its day stays on the plan in amber until someone confirms it for a new day.
</aside>

## The manager plans the day

On **Factory → To produce**, the board works as before: cards go from **Backlog** to **Preparing**, where the quantity is set, and from **Preparing** to **Assigned**, where the job order is created.

When a card is dropped on **Assigned**, the small window that asks *Who makes it?* now starts with a date and a button:

1. Pick the day. It opens on today.
2. Press **Plan for this day**.

A job order is created for that day with nobody named on it. Each card becomes its own job order, so each can be ordered and moved on its own. Several cards selected and dropped together are planned together, one job order each.

Picking a name from the list below still works as it always did: the whole job goes to that person and is not on any day's plan.

A job that already has someone named can be put on a plan too: press the pencil next to the name on its card and then **Plan for this day**. The name is taken off the job and the supervisor gives out its steps.

## The supervisor gives out the steps

**Factory → Operations → Day plan** lists the jobs planned for the day, one row per product on a job.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Order | the place of the job in the day - type a number to move it |
| Job | the job order and its state |
| Product | what is made |
| Qty | how many |
| Steps and operators | every step of the recipe: made so far / asked for, and who it is given to |
| Planned | the day it was planned for |

Each step has its own list of names. Choose one and that step appears on that person's floor screen, and on nobody else's. A step with an amber border has nobody yet; the bar at the top counts them, *3 steps without an operator*, so nothing is left out by mistake.

To change who does a step during the day, choose another name. To take a step back from someone, press the small cross in the list. If the person had already started, the work they did stays recorded under their name: the list only decides who sees the step from now on.

The date at the top moves to another day. Tomorrow's plan can be given out today.

## Following the day

The same page shows how the day is going, and refreshes on its own:

- the bar at the top: how many jobs, *12 of 18 steps done*, steps without an operator, jobs not finished on their day;
- beside each step: a grey circle (not started), an amber spinner (started) or a green tick (done), with the count made so far;
- *working now* and the name, when someone has the step open on the floor.

People who can see the page but do not run the floor see the names, not the lists.

## When the supervisor is away

The manager opens the same page and gives out the steps herself. Planning and giving out steps need the same position.

## What was not finished

A planned job with steps still open after its day is not dropped. From the next day on it shows on the Day plan with its old date in amber, and the bar counts it as *not finished on its day*. For each one, choose:

- **Confirm for** the day you are looking at - the job moves to that day's plan, at the end of the order;
- **Take off the plan** - the job stays as a job order but is on no day's plan.

Until one of the two is pressed, the job stays in front of you every day. Its steps also stay on the floor screens of the operators they were given to, so someone who paused a mix yesterday can carry on this morning.

When an operator closes a job short and moves the rest to a new job (see [Working the floor screen](/docs/working-the-floor-screen)), the new job keeps the planned day, the place in the order and the operator of each step.

## The morning materials check

The warehouse brings materials to the factory in whole boxes, not in exact amounts for the day. **Factory → Operations → Materials check** lists what the day plan still needs, so the factory checks what is there and asks the warehouse for the rest in one clear list.

Each line is one material, added up over every job of the day, with the jobs that need it (*JOaroma-0141, JOaroma-0145*). It counts only the steps not done yet: when the making is finished and only the packing is left, the line shows the boxes and labels and no longer the bottles. Mixes are made in the factory and are not on the list. Quantities come from the recipes, so a job whose recipe lists no materials needs nothing: the amber bar above the list names those jobs, so the gap in the recipe is seen.

| Column | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Material | the material and the warehouse stock code |
| For jobs | the jobs of the day that need it |
| Needed | how many the steps still to do use up |
| At the factory | how many are in the factory location now, and how many were already asked for today |
| Check | tick **Have enough**, or type roughly how many are missing |

When a missing number is typed, the line shows what the warehouse will bring, rounded up to its boxes: 1,200 missing with 500 to a box is *bring 3 boxes (1,500)*. A red *Warehouse short* means the warehouse does not hold that many, so you know straight away.

Press **Send to warehouse**. The missing lines go to the warehouse as one request, and the request appears above the list with each material marked *To bring*, *Delivered* or *Warehouse short*. Ticking everything as enough and sending records that the check was done. A second check later in the day only adds what is still missing.

The manager or the supervisor does the check, or gives it to an operator with **Checked by** at the top. That operator then sees a reminder on the floor screen that opens the check.

## The warehouse brings the materials

In the warehouse, **Goods out → For production** lists every material the factory asked for, in walking order of the shelf to take it from, with the stock code, the boxes to bring and the factory location they go to. The picker chooses the shelf, checks the quantity and presses **Delivered**. When the warehouse cannot bring it, **Warehouse short** tells the factory.

Delivered stock moves from the shelf to the factory location. It stays stock: it is counted and seen as before, and a customer order can still pick it there when the warehouse shelves are empty, the shelves always first. Materials not used can be moved back to a shelf from the factory location's page, like any other move between locations.

When a finished job is received into stock, its materials are used up from the factory location first, using the recipe quantities, and only then from other locations. Count the factory location now and then to correct breakages and waste.
