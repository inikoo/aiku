/**
 * Writes a delivery's cost checklist from the service invoices allocated to it, in the organisation currency:
 * shipping is the sum of its freight and local transport bills on top of the freight the agent invoiced, duty of
 * its duty bills (customs, anti-dumping, other import taxes), and every other bill is an extra row of its own.
 * Import VAT bills are recoverable and stay out. Rows typed by hand are left alone until a bill of their type
 * arrives, and a row the bills filled goes back to pending once no bill of its type is left.
